Project instructions:
     Link your GitHub account to TripleTen. You will need to enter your account credentials to confirm this action. 
     Clone the repository to your computer (the respository is automatically created when you link your GitHub account).  
     There will be a a series of four tests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
     For each test, use "LET" to help us define what we are looking for. We will be using letActualStatusCode and letActualResponseCode
     For each test, use "const" to identify that we want the response from our configured URL
     Each function for each test was named after what was expected to happen. For example, "should return status code 200". This ensures your tests are understable and help define what each specific test is for. 
     Once you have composed your tests, open up your file explorer
     In the address bar, type, "CMD" to open the command screen
     From here, enter the correct prompt to run your tests - example: npx jest tests/getHandlers.test.js
     View the results. If any tests fail, it will display on which line a potential error exists. Review, correct, and rerun the test(s).
     In order to push your tests, please use the following commands, in sequence, in the console: git add . then git commit -m "insert your comment"  then git push. This will push your updates.
